Monina - a taxi that is a safe space (Photo: Nina Mizrahi)
"Monina" - a taxi that is a safe space
Nina Mizrahi, owner of "Monina", a taxi intended for women, girls, girls and children, which was founded with the aim of providing a safe space, where women, girls and anyone who needs it, can get on a taxi and get to Hafzan district without fearing that they will go through an unpleasant experience of bullying or harassment.
"Monina" is the only one of its kind in Haifa. It began to operate about 4 years ago, following an evening of sitting with friends, when a lively conversation began about the repeated harassment and bullying experienced by many women, during a taxi ride. Mizrahi understood the need.
"That's how it all started," says Mizrahi, "I said to myself, voila, I'll be a women's taxi driver."

Some people don't like…
But it turns out that there are quite a few people who did not like the idea. Suddenly a group was formed on Facebook, with the aim of suing Monina on the grounds of gender discrimination. There were also taxi drivers who claimed that Mizrahi was taking their livelihood, "because it is clear that women will always prefer a woman to drive them", they claimed.
Maybe they should ask themselves why...

But recently extreme events took place, which caused Mizrahi to feel a real hardship. Just in the last few weeks "Monina" was hacked and corrupted - 3 times!
"I've been called names in the car 3 times, it's only recently," she says in despair. "In the 4 years that "Monina" has existed, it has been hacked 6 times in total, but recently there has been such a concentration of hacking cases, 3 times at my place and many other cases of other taxis in the area."

Hadar neighborhood, so what?
The area we are talking about, unsurprisingly, is the Hadar neighborhood, where in recent months the subject of the sense of personal insecurity of the residents of the neighborhood and those who hang around there has come up again and again. Nina is definitely not the only one.
"Hard sense of lawlessness"
"There were times when it was really fine," she says, "there were patrols, there were policemen walking around here, community policing, where are they now?" She wonders, then continues: "The truth is that lately there has been a sense of lawlessness, that everyone here in the neighborhood does what they want. Last week, 3 more taxis were broken into, this week only mine, the taxi was parked on Hillel Street and the week before they were also broken into, on Lid Street. That's what happening here. The feeling is one of lawlessness, I'm already quite desperate, I already want to throw up and give up everything."
Although it was mentioned that Mizrahi knows about parties who do not like the existence of "Monina", she does not know for sure that it is one of them. Everything can be. To be sure, it is very depressing to arrive at your car, private or business, and find it, again and again, after it has been vandalized.

In light of the situation that prevails in the neighborhood - repeated cases of violence, assaults, vandalism and crime, there is no doubt that the time has come to do something, and an hour earlier would be nice.
There have already been times, as Mizrahi said and as Hadar residents and business owners in the area report, that it was pleasant to walk around, that the neighborhood had already begun to raise its head and win back its dignity, and here, in a short time, Hadar was once again taken away from it, and who pays the price? As usual, these are the residents.

His uncle is Haifa's fallen shield
This is a jungle country.
The law should be changed and discrimination based on gender, religion, and nationality should be allowed where there is a reasonable fear that without such separation, there is a danger to public peace or the public feels itself threatened because it seeks to prevent the misuse and malicious purposes of the Anti-Discrimination Law in order to prevent another public from disturbing, harming or Tampering with the service or the body that provides it
A long time ago this should have been allowed by law for the benefit of everyone.
Excludes men from her business, to create a 'safe space' for women.
She complains that the streets are no longer safe, because there are not enough male policemen walking around.
The level of awareness of people…
And where is the pig with the black belt? Unable to handle her pig farm she created...Wonder Woman of the pigs
I'm in the market: "discrimination based on gender"??!! come on…
Nina is a private person - a charming woman far beyond a taxi driver - and as such she has the right to determine who her target audience will be! It does not harm anyone - neither customers nor taxi drivers! It's just pettiness and it's a shame that it comes to such severe violence.
Continue Nina on your blessed path! We are with you!
A violation of the laws of the State of Israel. Gender discrimination is prohibited.
Well done! I had an unpleasant experience years ago.. I took a taxi from Moriah Street. I had just left a restaurant. I told the driver the address and then he turned to a similar street. When I said it wasn't, he started arguing... instead of changing direction, he just kept silent and didn't say anything. I asked him to stop and it was fine. Not okay for a few seconds he continued to drive by the luck of God he stopped and I got off I ran away ..!
Yes, such taxis will multiply throughout the country, a genius idea!
This is exactly the reason to travel only with Monina, both girls and adults.
Prefer Nina Mizrahi over any other taxi driver.
Is the fact that there is more violence in Hadar and you see fewer policemen related to the fact that there is no budget for policing? That is, as long as there is no state budget, the police use the same budget for other tasks that currently seem more urgent?
I traveled with you. Lovely woman.
that you change the vehicle and remove the name of the taxi.
Taxi for women and children..safe space...excellent idea..want to strengthen Nina...don't give up....be strong..don't give up.
What's going on in Hadar? Why is there no community policing...I know a lot of people who live there....there was a period of quiet years....really scary....what's going on???????
Can I work for her as a taxi driver?
We only want taxis for men. It's scary to sit next to a woman, any unintentional touch could destroy an entire family. Good idea, but there should be taxis for men only without fear of a gender lawsuit.
Congratulations on your invitation. wonderful!!! And to all those with a narrow eye. Go ahead, there is a livelihood for everyone. It is good that there is also such an option, and for the men among us who wonder why a woman needed this initiative and turn it into a business:
1. Maybe it's time to take responsibility for the harassment you put the passengers/girls through? and stop them once and for all.
2. T P R G N U!!! It's free.
And to you Nina - continue the amazing project you started 4 years ago. You have identified a problem. You have created an idea and a business opportunity - well done!!!
Since the beginning of Kalish Hadar's tenure in free fall in every parameter. Kalisz is the disaster of Haifa.
You need to beat the bastards who did this
Well, of course today's police are everything, but policemen really aren't..maybe they collect income tax from them..they and the police have absolutely nothing to do with it
Shame and shame, no wonder they hate this body called the police
I would suggest to Yunina not to write ads about the taxi
She is an amazing and charming woman, we traveled with her many times, attributed the service to everything above expectations, why be harassed and hurt just why
