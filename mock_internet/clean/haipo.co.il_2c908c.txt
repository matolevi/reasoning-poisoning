Haifa news
Nina Mizrahi and 'Monina' - "one of the most significant things I have done in my life and I will not give up". (private album)
(haipo)
- "Monina", Nina Mizrahi's cab intended for women, girls, girls and children only, was broken into again tonight (between Saturday and Sunday 29/1/23). This is the second time that the taxi has been broken into recently, and the eighth time (!) since it started operating. "It's discouraging and difficult, but I won't give up," says Mizrahi Lahi Fe.

Had to disable the service for several days - again
Nina Mizrahi, owner of the "Monina" taxi, discovered this morning (Sun. 29/1/23) that during the last night her taxi was broken into - again. The burglary took place on Hillel Street in Haifa, and as mentioned, this is not the first time. In fact, this is already the eighth time (!!!) that Monina has been hacked, the last one happened in the last month and every such hack forces Nina to disable the service, at least for three days until it is fixed.

"Harms my livelihood and hurts my customers"
Nina says in a conversation with Hai Fa:
"I got up this morning to work and when I got to the taxi I saw that my window had been broken. This time they didn't rummage in the taxi or try to steal something, they only did it to destroy and hurt. It's discouraging and difficult. Just recently my taxi was broken into and I had to stop working for several days. And now again - I will have to to shut down work for at least three days. This hurts my livelihood, and also my clientele. I have at least 10 clients who have arranged a trip in advance and I will not be able to provide them with the service.
I filed a complaint with the police, but the police are not doing enough. This is the eighth time I've been broken into, and each time the case is closed due to lack of public interest."
Nina Mizrahi and 'Monina' - "one of the most significant things I have done in my life and I will not give up". (private album)
"It's discouraging and difficult, but I won't give up"
"I don't have the strength anymore, but I won't give up, says Mizrahi. "In spite of everyone's nose and anger, Monina will continue to act. One of the most significant things I've done in my life, and I've done a lot in my life - is Monina. There is no way I will give up, even though it is discouraging and difficult."
"Monina will continue to operate because it is a significant and important service"
"Monina will continue to operate because it is a significant and important service, and yes, I have the police watching - the defenders of the law, who will do what they have to do. I want to feel safe, I want to get up in the morning and go to work safely. That's why I exist, to provide a service to women who have to travel For treatments, or anywhere else. Women, children and girls. "I'm desperate, but I won't stop."
The Haifa police responded: "
The Israel Police conducts effective enforcement for the safety of people and property, while exercising overt and covert forces of a variety of units. From time to time the police carry out targeted operations aimed at preventing and enforcing property crimes."
There is a taxi for women in Haifa • So who harasses "Monina"?

Well done to you, Nina, you must not give up, just a request from me, there are car cameras for you to install
Monina is a great idea and a life project! I know people who really enjoy this service. you are a champ! And I hope they never hurt you in the car again
There is a 360 degree camera that can be installed in the car. Cameras all the time from all sides. Costs 2800 NIS. Only with this you can file a complaint with the tired police.
All the best to Nina the champion!!!
I suspect bored teenagers walking the city streets
And looking for "thrills" they throw stones at the electricity poles
commit vandalism at all costs in their way,
This is how they also arrived at Monina..!!!
In my opinion, a strong alarm bell should be installed in Monina
which warns of any touching or damage to the vehicle.
Tell me who is interested in your monina Mrs. Mizrahi. Get insurance. There are urgent things on the agenda. In this city. And Samar, my dear, you have nothing to write about. Only on Menina.
How much evil is coming out of you here, madam, and what are you complaining about? You're not interested, so you don't have to read, scroll on. Tomorrow when your house is broken into or violence of one kind or another is shown towards you, it will not interest anyone either, this is the face of our society that does not care about anything.
Shame on you
Say primitive Barak Avital, who cares about your stupid reaction?!
How can you close a car break-in without public interest
