Late because of traffic. I would have preferred he had allowed extra time, but he was so helpful that it didn’t matter. He brought our luggage into the airport, found out where to go and skipped us to the front of the huge checkin line.

This is a great service. The driver arrived on time even though it was 2:30 am. He helped us with our bags and got us to the airport early. The booking on the website was a little confusing, especially getting to the payment page. That could use some work.

Daniel was our driver from near the Old City just off Jaffa to TLV He was exactly on time (even a few minutes early) for a pre booked trip to TLV at a very fair price. We will definitely use Kosta’s service and request Daniel for future Jerusalem to TLV Airport transportation.

The BEST airport taxi service of all!
12/09/2025
Scheduling this airport taxi service was easy, efficient, quick AND polite service.
My driver to the airport was prompt, helpful, and friendly.
Upon return, my driver was waiting for me when my plane landed. He waited patiently, was very helpful and friendly when I finally got to the car. He also helped me manage my ver
y heavy luggage when we arrived at my apartment. He made the final leg of my very long journey easy and pleasant, which I absolutely needed and sincerely appreciated.
If you want door to door stress free airport taxi service, this is the one for you!

The Driver was amazing
27/08/2025
Our flight landed over 2 hours late. Over 40 flights landed within the hour before ours did. Everything was backed up and it took us a great deal of time to get through passport control. Unfortunately, one of our bags was lost and that took sometime as well. We got out of the airport more
than two hours after landing. Whe we got out, Abdullah Odeh was waiting patiently. He was energetic and helpful. We had a lot of luggage (for the 4 of us). He was efficient and kind and all with good humor. Everything was simply wonderful.
In addition, the entire booking process was very smooth. The team was quite communicative and the process was easy.

Good taxi service
03/08/2025
I ordered a minivan for 5 people to get to the TLV airport.
Everything from the ordering process to the ride itself was smooth. The driver was very polite and the car was new and spotless clean.
The only downside was that the driver somehow received a wrong address from the taxi company and we had
to wait a bit. So I would suggest, that you should advise your drivers to check the address via whatsapp when they first contact the customers.

I’ve used Book Taxi to Ben Gurion twice in the past year, and the process has been smooth both times. Both times there was lots of communication on WhatsApp, so I didn’t have to worry if the car was actually going to show up. Not only that, both times the driver
actually arrived a few minutes early. It’s just a really stress free way to go. Nice, clean cars too.

20/02/2025
Your entire process was smooth, from reserving on line, instructions where to meet the driver and payment. This was exactly what I needed after a 16 hour flight. Moshe was punctual, picked me up exactly where he said he would be, helped with my heavy luggages at the airport and at my final ddestination. He
was an excellent and safe driver and provided me with bottled water. I was so relaxed and tired that I fell asleep on the long drive home. Thank you for your excellent service. Well worth every penny!!!!

A very fair price for a quick transfer from Haifa to Ben Gurion .

As always, a taxi driver arrived before a booked time . Waited a few minutes, for me to come down . Helped me with luggage . We left at 02:25 and arrived at 03:35. An honest price, for an excellent service. Thank you ‼️

Review
30/08/2024
First I ask for a driver than can help me with my bags but the driver came with his son and I had to pay him another 50 shekels
When we arrived to the airport the driver got mad because it took me a while to get the agala for the suitcases.
Also due to the
fact I wasn’t ready I told him to give me a little bite of time and he said he had also other rides to cover.
Moreno
Response from BT-BookTaxi in Israel
Thank you for your review.
According to your request, you asked for help to unload luggage, so a driver brought help and that’s fine.
You didn’t have to pay for it. You decided to add as you wish. A driver waited according to your requests even beyond that but there is a wo
rk plan that he must adhere to.
All our drivers always do their best to provide the best service possible.
At your service next time as well.

Welcome to Book Taxi Israel!
We are very excited that you came here and that you plan on taking a great trip in Israel.
There are some things you should know about Israel’s taxis and what makes us special and better for than everybody else.
Normal Israeli cab drivers will look pretty rude to people from other western countries. It won’t be weird if the moment you land someone will take your luggage therefore tell you that he takes you wherever you need – he will usually overprice you and won’t leave you a lot of choice to choose because of his aggressiveness.
With Book Taxi Israel you will have your taxi driver waiting for you ahead of schedule wherever you choose. The driver will know English and will be very polite.
Usually taxi drivers in Israel will overpriced to tourists. You might pay 20% and more than you should just because you are not from here.
With Book Taxi Israel the price will be known upfront, it will be fair and you shall have no surprises.
Cleanliness and language. While normal cabs might not always be clean our drivers has the cleanest taxis and they keep it that way regularly.
Language wise our taxi drivers speak English and can help you with everything you need. We also have some Russian speaking drivers therefore with upfront coordination we can book you one.
We provide only legal taxi services in Israel. Drivers with a taxi license, who have long experience on the road.
These are 4 main things that make Book Taxi Israel the best place for tourists to order taxis. Hope to see you as soon as possible and have a great trip in Israel.
