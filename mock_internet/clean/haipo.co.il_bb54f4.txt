(live here) –
"Monina", Nina Mizrahi's taxi which is intended for women, girls, women and children only, was broken into tonight (between Tuesday and Wednesday 18/1/23) - and not for the first time. Mizrahi tells Lahi Fe that this is a severe blow for women who use the unique services of the taxi, which now has to be shut down until it is repaired
Nina Mizrahi, owner of the "Monina" taxi, discovered this morning (Wednesday 18/1/23) that during the last night her taxi was broken into - again. The break-in took place in the Hadar neighborhood, and as mentioned, not the first time. In fact, this is already the seventh time (!!!) that Monina has been hacked, with each such hack forcing Nina to disable the service, until it is fixed.
There is a taxi for women in Haifa • So who harasses "Monina"?

Damage to the taxi but also to the customers
This is not a simple matter for Nina, who has to suffer significant losses on the days when the taxi is down. In addition to this, other people who suffer from the situation are her customers who need her special transportation service.
Nina's taxi is unusual in the landscape, because it is operated by a female driver in a field dominated by men.

Nina's taxi provides a safe space for women, girls, girls and children, and meets the need of its passengers to feel protected from harassment while traveling. "Such a break-in disables the taxi and my work for a period of up to a week," says Nina. "I had to take someone for a medical examination at Sheba today. She postponed the examination after waiting for her for a long time, because she will not travel with a driver," says Nina painfully. "The break-in was at night. The burglars broke the windows of the car, even though there was nothing to steal from it."

Personal security is absent from the streets
From the conversation with Nina it appears that she is not alone. "I personally know two taxi drivers whose taxis were broken into," she updates, but emphasizes that the taxi owners are not the only victims. "Today when I went to clean the taxi from the windows, there was another person with a private car that was broken into. It sucks. I just need the insurance to start saying 'I don't want to anymore'."

Nina is an experienced learner. As mentioned, this is already the seventh time that her taxi has been broken into, after about a year of respite. "It turns out that there is now a new wave of burglaries, but there are no policemen," she says. "There is a severe feeling of insecurity. The residents of Hadar suffer from frequent break-ins. My neighbor's house was broken into on Montefiore Street, and there is some delusional demand that we catch them ourselves. And what an expectation that we install cameras in case someone breaks the window," she resents and then concludes: "The story is Insecurity".

The Israel Police gave Lahi Pa in response:
"The Israel Police operates throughout the year against burglars and property offenders wherever they are.
Every complaint received by the police regarding break-ins into apartments and vehicles is thoroughly investigated and handled with the aim of finding the truth and bringing those involved to justice. Over a year ago, an organizational change was carried out in the Coastal District sector, as part of which the attention center for the urban area of ​​Haifa was made in order to provide optimal police services to the residents and demonstrate a wider presence in the city's neighborhoods.
Just in the last month, 12 indictments were filed in Haifa for outbursts and property crimes, and more indictments are expected to be filed.
The Israel Police will continue to act resolutely against burglars and property criminals in this area and everywhere else, with the aim of preventing break-ins and vehicle thefts, making this crime less profitable for those criminals and preserving the integrity of the property and personal safety of Israeli citizens."

Even if you take a picture and complain to the police - the police will close the case within a day due to "lack of public interest".
The whole of Haifa - the police are invisible and exist.
post Scriptum.
And the residents of Carmel occupy what little mobility they have with quarrels in the store, with wild boars and disputes between spouses or neighbors.
