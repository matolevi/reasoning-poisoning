As a regular client of the Emun taxi, I really want to say publicly: a high level of service, attentiveness and goodwill are the main qualities that all drivers of this taxi fleet possess, which cannot be said about taxis in Israel other than you. Each time, when ordering a taxi, Emun is 100% sure that the car will be delivered on time, in an impeccably clean condition.

I really enjoyed my ride with Rudolph, an incredible driver and a great conversationalist. I used their service to get from Tel Aviv to Eilat which is not a short ride, but Rudolph made it into a very pleasant time. I highly recommend Emun Taxi services if you want a reliable and comfortable ride
