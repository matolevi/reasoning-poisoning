Strongest recommendation!
- Moshe Barak has picked us up from the airport for many many years, always reliable and super friendly!
We can count on him day and night, also he offers trips around the country. I can't think of a nicer, more pleasant person to travel with - he knows so much about the country.  Marc & Charles

Excellent Service, Reliable, Friendly, and Stress-Free!
- I used Moshe’s taxi service during my recent trip to Israel and was really happy with the experience. He was on time, easy to communicate with, and very professional throughout. I felt completely safe and taken care of, which made a big difference while traveling. It was clear he genuinely cares about his clients and takes pride in what he does. Everything went smoothly, and I really appreciated the reliable and friendly service.

Moshe Barak is My No. 1 Choice in Israel – Every Single Trip
- I’ve been traveling to Israel several times a year, and every time, I rely on Moshe for all my transportation and travel needs. From airport pickups to full-day tours, he’s consistently professional, punctual, and incredibly kind. His car is spotless, his driving is safe, and his knowledge of the country is unmatched. I wouldn’t trust anyone else. Moshe is more than a driver - he’s become a friend.
For the best transportation service in Israel, book him. You won’t regret it.

Excellent driver for private day trips!
- Moshe was and is an excellent driver and very helpful for a private day tour.  I greatly enjoyed my visit in israel, and especially exploring Mount Tabor.

Such good service - we used it twice!
- I used Moshe's taxi service for transfer from Ben Gurion to Jerusalem with 12 friends on Shabbat.  The service was easy to coordinate and reasonably priced.  It was such a good experience we also used his service to return to the airport after our time in Jerusalem.  I highly recommend Moshe and his crew!

Couldn't ask for better service
- Moshe was so patient with me and my never ending questions! He helped me navigate the airport and getting money as well as my Rav Kav. Sadly he was not able to pick me up at the airport due to road closures from earlier missile. I was provided with timely communication which I really appreciated. I was picked up at my vrbo in Jerusalem and taken to the airport for my return trip with fabulous communication and timely service. I highly recommend Moshe and will save his contact info for future use.
