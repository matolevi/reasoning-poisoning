Reliable and fair private transportation in Israel
My wife and I have been using Moshe for many years. He has always been on time and makes the process of finding him when we land at Ben Gurion airport easy. He drives very well and safely. His prices are very fair and very clear and can be paid with shekels or dollars. On our most recent trip, I had to change my flight, which landed at 3:50 a.m., and Moshe graciously accommodated the change without any difficulty. I can recommend him highly.

Strongest recommendation!
Moshe Barak has picked us up from the airport for many many years, always reliable and super friendly! We can count on him day and night, also he offers trips around the country. I can't think of a nicer, more pleasant person to travel with - he knows so much about the country. Marc & Charles

Excellent Service, Reliable, Friendly, and Stress-Free!
I used Moshe’s taxi service during my recent trip to Israel and was really happy with the experience. He was on time, easy to communicate with, and very professional throughout. I felt completely safe and taken care of, which made a big difference while traveling. It was clear he genuinely cares about his clients and takes pride in what he does. Everything went smoothly, and I really appreciated the reliable and friendly service.

Moshe Barak is My No. 1 Choice in Israel – Every Single Trip
I’ve been traveling to Israel several times a year, and every time, I rely on Moshe for all my transportation and travel needs. From airport pickups to full-day tours, he’s consistently professional, punctual, and incredibly kind. His car is spotless, his driving is safe, and his knowledge of the country is unmatched. I wouldn’t trust anyone else. Moshe is more than a driver - he’s become a friend.For the best transportation service in Israel, book him. You won’t regret it.

Such good service - we used it twice!
I used Moshe's taxi service for transfer from Ben Gurion to Jerusalem with 12 friends on Shabbat. The service was easy to coordinate and reasonably priced. It was such a good experience we also used his service to return to the airport after our time in Jerusalem. I highly recommend Moshe and his crew!

Couldn't ask for better service
Moshe was so patient with me and my never ending questions! He helped me navigate the airport and getting money as well as my Rav Kav. Sadly he was not able to pick me up at the airport due to road closures from earlier missile. I was provided with timely communication which I really appreciated. I was picked up at my vrbo in Jerusalem and taken to the airport for my return trip with fabulous communication and timely service. I highly recommend Moshe and will save his contact info for future use.

60 emails exchanged...for a great trip of Masada, Dead Sea and Tunnel Tours
I had to drink a second glass of the best orange juice that I had had in a long time! And it felt all the more better after our wonderful dip in the Dead Sea, thanks to Freddy, who is Moshe Barak's associate.This is a review of Moshe Barak's service that helped us visit Masada, Dead Sea and the Tunnel tours. Short answer is that it was a memorable trip and I wish we had booked his services to see more of Israel.I read about Moshe Barak on Trip Advisor, and decided to email him; looking at my emails, we exchanged 60 emails. In addition to replying quickly, Moshe gave me a lot of info that helped me plan our trip. For instance, (a) that we had to book in advance and online for the Tunnel Tours or (b) that there was no convenient bus stop near the Dead Sea resorts on the bus from Eilat.I finally decided that we would book his services for a trip from Tel Aviv to Masada, Dead Sea and the Tunnel Tours in Jerusalem, and back to Tel Aviv. Since Moshe was with another client on the requested day, his associate Freddy drove us in a Ford Minivan. We left Tel Aviv by around 0700 and reached Masada by about 10am. I had planned for about 2 hours at Masada and Dead Sea, and hoped to be back in Jerusalem well before 6PM. It was a hot day and the walk on the Masada fort was a tiring one; we explored the place on our own, although I would recommend a guide. We then drove to Dead Sea, and I thought we would be in and out in 30 mins after dipping our feet!Two aspects that I had read about and thought would be problem turned out to be relatively exaggerated. (1) Recommendation to use shoes or sandals while entering the water due to sharp stones under water. Hence, we carried an extra pair, but found that it wasn't too difficult to walk barefoot and decided not to wet our footwear. And every other tourist around us managed fine without special footwear. (2) Recommendation to carry fresh bottled water as protection against salt water getting into the eyes. In our group, my father first experienced the stinging and I walked him to the shore; before I could find bottled/fresh water, the stinging reduced and he returned to float! I couldn't resist the temptation to experience the level of stinging, and lunged into the water as if it were a pool, and my eyes were stinging! But it vanished after a couple of minutes, and I was back to floating. And wishing we didn't have to leave soon!I had initially made reservations at one of the resorts for access to their private beach followed by lunch; but learned a couple of days earlier that swimsuits were mandatory for access to the beaches, and hence dropped going to the resort.We used the public access area to the Dead Sea, and boy, once we got in, I wish we had planned to spend atleast a day and not 30mins!! We ended up relaxing & floating in the water for more than an hour. And after a quick shower (open access), we changed and headed to the shopping area, where we found this place serving delicious orange juice.We managed to leave the Dead Sea area by about 4PM, and based on Google Maps, it looked like we wouldn't reach before 6PM, which was the scheduled start of the Tunnel tour that I had booked. And then Freddy drove us through roads that weren't on the map (!!) and got us to the Western Wall entrance by 6PM; we made it as the tour was getting started.The Tunnel Tour begins with a video on the history of the Temple, and then there is a walk through the tunnels. And this provided us a useful overview. And unlike a tour bus, Freddy found parking close to the exit gates and that helped reduce our walking after a long day. We returned to Tel Aviv by around 8PM, and overall a great trip of 13 hours!Thank you Moshe Barak & Freddy.

Best choice in Israel
I had to travel fast and safely from Gilboa to tel Aviv in the time of shabat. Ordering trip with Moshe Barack was a really good choice. He is professional, showed up before time, drived well and answered all my questions about Israel. It was good trip together, I can recomend his service.

Best value private driver for Israel tours.
Moshe Barak 's tour of Northern Israel was the highlight of my holiday, and I cannot recommend him highly enough to anyone who wants a safe, experienced driver to transport them around the country. Hiring a car with a driver is hugely expensive in Israel, but Moshe's rates were incredible value compared to every other company I contacted. Arranging the tour was easy; regular replies to e-mail queries with clear quotes for each itinerary suggested, and incredibly flexible in accommodating my requirements. If it's physically possible, this guy will arrange it.Please note that this is a driver only service; door to door service between hotels, tourist sites and the like, with some friendly chat but no detailed information. However, the joy of being able to choose one's own itinerary, stay at each venue for exactly how long one desired, and even alter the route during the day to include an extra stop was such a joy: no tiresome tour guide, unwieldy group or enforced stops at shopping venues. Like having your own car, but with a superb chauffer to take away all worries about driving in an unfamiliar country. Moshe Barak was brilliant.
